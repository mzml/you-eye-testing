Java can be used to automate testing activities during software development. Automated tests can be used in software development to run as part of a release every time you make a change to your application. Java allows you to build an automated testing platform for the web. Here I am using
- TestNG as a testing framework
- Selenium WebDriver to interact with the browser
- Maven to manage the project
- Cucumber as a collaboration tool

You can fork this repo and create your own tests. Let's say we are working on an application that requires you to sign in like http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/login. We can automate the sign in interaction of someone wanting to access their account. You can automate this process by using this framework.
Help in developing this framework is appreciated.
