# Testing with automated :eyes:
App development is done iteratively and with quality in mind. It can help to have certain tests automated during development. This is a template for building a test automation framework.

## :coffee:
Automated tests can be used in software development to run as part of a release every time you make a change to your application. Java allows you to build an automated testing platform for the web. Here I am using
- JUnit as a testing framework
- Selenium WebDriver to interact with the browser
- Maven to manage the project
- Cucumber as a collaboration tool

## Don't Repeat Yourself
Cucumber best used with everyone on the team using it as documentation.
